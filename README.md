# ib-tsp
Exploring a range of crossover algorithms for the travelling salesman problem, as part of my IB HL computer science course. THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.

## Modes

This program has multiple modes you can choose from. Whether the tours are drawn every generation, whether the program should pause between each generation etc. 

### Slow mode

This is aimed at being able to see the process as it is occuring. An example can be seen below.

### Fast mode

This is aimed at seeing how well these algorithms can perform. An example can be seen below.

## Why?

The case study for my cohort was genetic algorithms, focusing on the commonly used "travelling salesman problem". I used this project as way to further explore the concepts learnt in class to gain a deeper understanding.
