Exploring a range of crossover algorithms for the travelling salesman problem, as part of my IB HL computer science course. THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.

## Why?

The case study for my cohort was genetic algorithms, focusing on the commonly used "travelling salesman problem". I used this project as way to further explore the concepts learnt in class to gain a deeper understanding.
